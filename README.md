# TRIO_RVEMVS
The codes in this folder is used for implementing method TRIO_RVEMVS which is proposed from
paper "TRIO RVEMVS: A Bayesian framework for rare variant association analysis with expectation-maximization variable selection using family trio data".
TRIO_RVEMVS is an expectation maximization variable selection (EMVS) method to simultaneously detect common and rare variants at the individual variant level using family trio data.
